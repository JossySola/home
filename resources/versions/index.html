            <h3>Development</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This project apart from being part of Codecademy full-stack course, is something I wanted to do since the first time I joined the course and the idea I had in mind was to display three categories that I consider are part of my life: The experience I have in <u>Customer Service & Administration</u>, the journey I'm taking with the <u>Full-Stack course</u>, and the <u>interest I have in art</u>.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 id="design">Design Process</h5>
            <p>After some thinking I came across the idea of <em>simulating a computer desktop</em> and organize the three categories in folders and with that in mind, I made a <a href="../docs/Normal Version.pdf" target="_blank">Design Template</a> with <strong>Microsoft Publisher</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I began with the <u>Structure of HTML</u>, the <u>Styling with CSS</u>, and also the creation of the images I needed like the <u>folders</u> and <u>file icons</u>, which were make with <strong>Inkscape</strong>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I chose <strong>Inkscape</strong> and more specifically the <strong>SVG format</strong> because I wanted my images to be scalable without compromising their quality.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h5>
            <br>
            <p>With <u>CSS Media Queries</u> I targeted the responsiveness needed. However, this time I learnt I could target the devices width directly with a mix of: max-<u>device-width</u> and the <u>orientation:portrait</u> property.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition, the relative measures: <u>rem</u>, <u>vw</u> and <u>vh</u> were the key to successfuly resize content in certain situations. Nonetheless, according to good practices ( <strong>PageSpeed Insights</strong> ), images are elements that are recommended to be set with specific measures.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h5>
            <br>
            <p>The scripting of the website is made with <u>JavaScript Vanilla</u>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first feature I focused on was the <u class="highlight">Selection feature</u> which highlights the folder/file that is clicked on. However, the challenge I faced with this feature was the fact that when using the Click event, if the folder was clicked, it activated in both the folder and the parent containing the folder ( <em>which later on I read it is part of the capturing/bubbling event phase</em> ).</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>My approach:</strong><br>Having in mind I didn't know about capturing/bubbling at the time, I observed that logging the clicks in an array, the first ID in the array was the folder/file and the second item in the array was the parent containing it ( the <u>"Desk"</u>, </em><em>bubbling phase</em> ), so I wrote a function that compares the first item with the parent ID, if both are the same, the function makes all the <em>highlight images</em> hidden, otherwise, it hides all the highlight images and then makes the selected image visible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The second feature was <u class="highlight">Open Window</u>. The Window is a grid containing two parts: <u>The top window bar</u> and <u>The content space</u>. The top bar containing a Close Tab and a Back Tab. This function is part of the <u>Desk Class</u> and it has various conditions:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>If there is a Window already opened</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the folder <u>has no content</u></li>
                    <li>If the action is to <u>open a file</u></li>
                    <li>If the folder <u>has folders inside</u></li>
                </ul>
                <li>If the Window is new</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>The third feature to focus on was to <u class="highlight">Create a File</u>, this being part of the <u>File Class</u>, and which is called every time you open a folder.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The function creates a Grid element, displaying the file: The first row containing the icon and the second row containing the title of the file. The images depending on the <u>type of file</u>:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Folder</li>
                <li>Text</li>
                <li>Web</li>
                <li>Presentation</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>The <u class="highlight">content of the files</u> is stored in an external module organized in arrays. The arrays contain different items representing information such as the titles, language, content, target, etc. and the functions use this data to display and create.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Furthermore, the project separates the JavaScript usage in <u>three modules</u>:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>First Event Listeners</li>
                <li>Classes and Functions</li>
                <li>Content Database</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>The HTML loaded for the client only loads the <u>main.js</u> which size is only 4KB and sets the first Event Listeners.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The other two modules are only used when they are required by the <u>main JS</u>.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>PENDING FEATURES/ISSUES:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript is not working on iOS platform.</li>
                <li>Optimize JavaScript Structure</li>
            </ul>
